        Fjällräven was born out of one man’s vision: a vision to make nature
        accessible to more people.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Åke Nordin was born in Örnsköldsvik, on Sweden’s High Coast, in 1936.
        Combining rolling hills, deep forests and sheltered coastline it was the
        perfect playground for a young, curious Åke. And it was on one of his
        many adventures that the seed for Fjällräven was planted, deep in Åke’s
        mind.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        The idea arose out of necessity: to create a backpack that swallowed up
        gear, but sat comfortably on his back. Åke knew there must be a way.
        With his mother’s sewing machine and his father’s tools, Åke created a
        wooden-framed backpack in his basement. And with it, the seed was sown.
        10 years later, in 1960, in that same basement, Åke founded Fjällräven
        and launched his first product for sale. Guess what is was? Yep, a
        backpack; this time with an aluminium frame.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        During the 1960s and 70s, fuelled by Åke’s stubborn belief that there
        must always be a way – a practical solution –the Fjällräven product
        range expanded significantly, with tents, sleeping bags, jackets and
        trousers. The Greenland Jacket, the Expedition Down Jacket and the
        Kånken backpack proved to be defining products. Virtually every other
        Swede, from avid trekker to enthusiastic nature lover, wore and trusted
        Fjällräven.

      <p class="mt-5">
        The 80s and 90s were more about geographical expansion. Trekking through
        nature, going slowly, carrying everything you need on your back while
        enjoying every step, shouldn’t just be something for Swedes. First we
        expanded throughout Scandinavia, then further afield in Europe. But it
        wasn’t enough for Åke to just offer the clothing and equipment to get
        out in nature. His dream was to actually enable people to get out there.
        He wanted more people to trek through the wilderness; because the more
        people experience nature, the more likely they are to care for it. And
        again, he knew there must be a way. His dream became a reality in 2005
        with the launch of Fjällräven Classic: a 110km-long trek through
        northern Sweden.{" "}

        And with nature being so important to us, here at Fjällräven, we’ve
        placed more and more emphasis on sustainable development; to develop on
        nature’s terms. Since the new millennium, we’ve launched Eco-Shell, our
        Down Promise and the Fjällräven Way – our Code of Conduct.

        Then in 2017 we became very nostalgic. We returned to where Åke first
        drew inspiration, the Swedish mountains, to create our mountaineering
        collection: Bergtagen. And now, in 2018, we’re revisiting that first
        defining product, the Greenland Jacket and the collection it forged, to
        create Greenland Updated.

      <p class="mt-5">
        But whether we’re looking forward, backwards or sideways for
        inspiration, we’re always moving towards a common goal. Enabling and
        inspiring more people to experience nature was Åke’s vision and we now
        make it our mission. Nature is in our DNA. We simply can’t deviate from
        it. Without it, we’d be nothing. It is our past, present and future.
        It’s our forever.
